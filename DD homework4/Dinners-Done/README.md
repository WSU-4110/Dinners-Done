CSC4110 Semester project (S/S 2022)

CSC4110 Course Project (S/S 2022)

The overall concept for this project is utility. A website is created on which recipes are stored in a database. Users can sign into accounts and choose any number of 
recipes to add to a shopping list. Once finished with selection, the user can then hit "Print" and a list with the total ingredients necessary for purchase will be 
supplied. This enables the user to make a quick trip to a supermarket to attain all goods necessary for producing all meals chosen.

Main functional components: 
-Working website with internal links to other pages and external links to any recipes that are owned by another site (copywright therefore 
protected) 
-User sign-up and sign-in process that saves selected recipes 
-Database of users 
-Database of recipes that can be added to by user entries 

Coding components: 
-arrays required to hold ingredient list and main array to hold totals of all items from those selected
-printing function that will output the "final" array of totals
-Recipe class structures for recipes to easily implement additions
-function for adding Recipe class objects
    *decided on one set structural array that contains every possible item...this will make combining arrays into one "final" easiest to 
    implement within course timeline


BELOW WILL BE A LIST OF MINUTES FROM MEETINGS
    *Group decided that we will alternate responsibility of updating weekly Minutes

5/17 -Projects announced and teams decided upon

-Each member of the group was asked to volunteer for a particular component of the project. These will provide the main functionality of the project. 
As the project progresses, we can add functionality or detailing if possible, but primary objective is production of working, bug-free product. 
-Website structure (HTML/CSS)- HILDA QARDAGH (Kristina Karnick will provide past website and css project file to assist and expediate) 
-User sign-up/sign-in and database - OMAR GUDINO 
-Recipe database and eventual links to each - CODY SHEA 
-Additional recipe entry process and selection functionality - BRUNO MARTINS 
-Backend (arrays, functions, classes, etc.) and main debugging - MOHAMMED CHOKR, KRISTINA KARNICK 
     **After-class discussions on basic structures and assignment of individual components that can be begun prior to completion of other parts of project

-Decided to have 1 PowerPoint begun and shared. Each member can add details to his/her own slide with details of duties and progress 
-As sprints progress, components that require more time/work than others can be re-addressed and jobs shared 
-Main functionality the primary goal of first sprint. Later sprints likely to be fine-tuning and perfecting; additional functionality or database entries if 
 time permits
