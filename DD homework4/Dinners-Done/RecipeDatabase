When cloning the repo do not create a folder for it, just go to the directory you want it and it will make the folder for you when you clone.
I have commented out code that can easily show all the data in the database to make it easier for us to work on, just uncomment as needed.
I have also included the functionality and queries needed for the searchability.
There is 3 recipes in there for now until I know this will work out for us then I can add more.

Kristina and I had some issues getting the DB to work in a new environment, it seemed the biggest problem was the path to the database.
if needed, replace the string url line for the database to :
String url = "jdbc:sqlite:CSC4100Project/src/main/resources/RecipesDB.db"; //path from content root
the sqlite-jar should already be there as a dependancy so this should be the only major issue is getting everyones path to the DB to work.
If it still does not work, go to file -> project structure, then modules tab to make sure the sqlite-jar is in there, and feel free to message me 
to figure things out as well, there is plenty of issues I am sure I have not run into so we may have to solve them together.
