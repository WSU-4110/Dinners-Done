# Recipe Entry Page
---

This is a simple recipe entry page. I used Hilda's css, so its consistent with her design.

As requested, user will enter Recipe Name, Recipe Author, Recipe URL, and the full Recipe in the text box.

The user input from html file is save in a variable in index.js function. 

I added an alert() to test javascript is reading the variable where user input is stored.
