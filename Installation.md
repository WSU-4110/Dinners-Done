# Dinners-Done
CSC4110 Semester project (S/S 2022)

Welcome to the dinners done installation guide!!!

The overall concept for this project is utility. A website is created on which recipes are stored in a database. Users can sign into accounts and choose any number of 
recipes to add to a shopping list. Once finished with selection, the user can then hit "Print" and a list with the total ingredients necessary for purchase will be 
supplied. This enables the user to make a quick trip to a supermarket to attain all goods necessary for producing all meals chosen.

                                                                          Steps to take to install
                                                                          
                                                                          You would need to start by using a Java IDE such as Eclipse, intellij, NetBeans, MyEclipse, and many others that work with java.
                                                                          
                                                                          Then you would need to install a java environment and add variables based on the version you have installed. For example 
                                                                          this would be a java environment version 17. (Ex: C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-17.0.1).
                                                                          
                                                                          You would then need Apache Tomcat 10 to run the server and the jar file that we have uploaded.
